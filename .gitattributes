# Github Linguist has a policy of "popularity" for inclusion (200+ unique
# non-fork user/repo) and, sadly, so far the MODULE.bazel include files
# have a rather minimal footprint:

*.MODULE.bazel linguist-language=Starlark

# mark the docs (except README) as generated so they are collapsed in GH PRs
