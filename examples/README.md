# ðŸ“Ž Examples

This Bazel module provides examples that demonstrate how to use this repo in an
external project.

It also serve as end-to-end smoke tests, validating the user-facing setup. It
helps catch issues in the installation instructions or failures that only show
up when the repo is used as an external dependency. Additionally, it also runs
as part of the presubmit checks for the Bazel Central Registry.
